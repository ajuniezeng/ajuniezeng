## About Me

My English name is Ajunie Zeng.

I'm not quite good at programming but I'd like to explore all kinds of things related in this field. Right now I'm still a college student and also an mediocre guy. Drop me an email or just text me if there is any interesting thing you want to share with me! I'm super open minded. You can find me nearly on every social media (if you want to dig it out 🤓).

I'm now into TypeScript and Rust (maybe tomorrow you can find me fall in love another languages ✌️). I'm heading to be a full stack developer. Hope I can do it.
